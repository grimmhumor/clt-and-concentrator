> Enhance your game's conditions. Make them be applied automatically via a set of triggers, run a macro when they are applied/removed and other goodies.

# Features

## Condition Lab

<details>

![enhanced-conditions](https://github.com/death-save/media/blob/master/combat-utility-belt/enhanced-conditions.gif)

It's not enough to _show_ your players when they're poisoned, you want to really drive it home by linking the condition so they can wallow in misery as they fail their ability checks.

This feature allows you to create your own status effects and link them to reference entries (Journal, Item, or compendium) with further info on that status effect.

## Triggler

<details>
  <summary>Click to show</summary>

Trigger the addition or removal of Conditions, and/or the execution of Macros based on changes to actor/token properties such as HP
